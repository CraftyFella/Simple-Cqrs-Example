Still very much a work in progress.. The idea was to create a CQRS demo for a work presentation. I didn't want to have to use any particular technologies, as I know the best part of CQRS is the freedom you have when choosing a technology.

So I started with Greg Young's example which is as simple as it gets. 

Took Greg Youngs simple cqrs example:

Then I added a few things, that we'll need like:

1. Testing
2. Sqlite reporting support and sqlite event store support
3. IoC support using Ninject (Not plugable at the minute, but working on it)

Took the Testing and Reporting ideas from Mark Nijhof's Cqrs example:

Took the NServiceBus Extension ideas from Tyrone Groves Simple Cqrs example framework:
